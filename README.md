- 👋 Hi, I’m @zuluechopapa.  people often call me 'zep', it's a nickname with lots of mileage.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...  ugh.  too many things.   reading, writing, music, photography.  or linux in general and perl/shell for computer systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I should be working on python.   I'm often working on Jenkins these days.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't even know.
- 📫 How to reach me ... hm.  I dunno if I want to put that in here yet.

oh, but I do want to put in a gpg key.  so be a big enough dork to use gpg, and you'll get my contact method, too.

```
